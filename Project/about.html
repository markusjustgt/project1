                        <p class="lead"> Student Scholarships U is here to help you during your whole journey as a student athlete. Below is the stages we will help you through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Stage 1: Information.</b> Before we get started with the recruiting process, we are here to help you and your family have an understanding of the college system, rules, scholarship opportunities and what to expect going through the recruiting process.</li>
                            <li><b>Stage 2: Evaluation.</b> Our experienced consultants will get to know you better as a student, an athlete, and as a person. By knowing this, we will be able to find the right fit for you.</li>
                            <li><b>Stage 3: Recruiting.</b> Our consultants will use their connections to initiate contact with American university coaches. This will generate interest in each player. </li>
                            <li><b>Stage 4: The Decision.</b>After the recruiting process is finished, you will have a decision to make. We will help you and your family understand the offers that have been made, and work together to determine which university is right for you.</li>
                            <li><b>Stage 5: Testing.</b>Once you have chosen the perfect school, you will need to take an entrance exam. We will provide you study material and help set up an exam time. We will also help you through the visa process.</li>
                            <li><b>Stage 6: Mentor.</b> We know that moving to a new country and starting at a new school can be challenging so we will remain in contact with you, as a mentor, throughout your entire college career.</li>
